# IriSync Logo Assets

This directory should contain the following logo assets:

## Logo Variants

1. **Horizontal Logo** (`logo-horizontal.png` or `logo-horizontal.svg`)
   - Used in the website header, footer, and documentation
   - SVG format preferred for scalability, or high-resolution PNG (at least 600px wide)

2. **Large Logo** (`logo-large.png`)
   - Used for splash screens, hero sections, and marketing materials
   - High-resolution PNG or SVG (at least 1200px in the largest dimension)

3. **IriSync Logo** (`irisync-logo.svg` or `irisync-logo.png`)
   - Parent company logo for about pages, footer, legal sections
   - SVG format preferred for scalability

## Best Practices

- SVG format is preferred for logos whenever possible for perfect scaling at any size
- PNG format should be used when SVG is not available, with transparent backgrounds
- Logos should have appropriate padding around them within the file
- Keep file sizes optimized (compress PNGs, optimize SVGs)

## Usage in Application

The application will reference these logos in the following locations:
- Header navigation: horizontal logo
- Footer: horizontal logo and IriSync logo
- Authentication pages: large logo
- About/Company pages: all logo variants
- Marketing materials: large logo
